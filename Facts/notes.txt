Of some note is the fact that the atmospheric drag rate changes over time, most 
notably with the solar cycle, but it can change for a variety of reasons, 
especially for a body as dynamic as the ISS. With the current altitude ranging around 400. 
The time that it took to go from 414 to 406 km was about 2.5 months, or, say, 75 days. That
means that the drag on the spacecraft is about 106 m/day. Orbital energy can be calculated 
by 𝑒𝑘=𝑚∗𝑣2/2. The energy at 406km is 29400301 J, and at 406.1 is 29399868 J*mass.
Thus, 433 J*mass of energy is lost per day. The force is applied over all that time period 
to make that energy lost. 𝐹=𝑚∗𝐴 provides us that 433 J*mass / (Distance traveled in a day) = m*a. 
Thus, the constant acceleration that would keep it at the same orbit is 
about 6.56𝑒−7𝑚/𝑠2, or 0.656𝜇𝑚/𝑠2.

Given the station mass of 419455kg, the decelerating force would be 0.275 newtons.
